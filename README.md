# Git Assignment - sijiao-liu  

## a. What is an **_issue_**?
GitHub Issues are items you can create in repository to plan, discuss and track work. 
- Issues are simple to create and flexible to suit a variaty of scenarios. 
- You can use issues to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks, and efficiently communicate with others.
(Ref: [About issues - GitHub Docs] (https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues "GitHub Doc/GitHub Issues/Issues")

Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. 
- As issues are created, they'll appear here in a searchable and filterable list. 
(Ref: description given by the issues tab in the GitHub repository created)


## b. What is a **_pull request_**?
A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.
- In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
- Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch.
(Ref: [About pull request - GitHub Docs] (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests "GitHub Doc/Pull requests/Collaborate with pull requests/Propose changes")

Pull requests help you collaborate on code with other people.
- As pull requests are created, they will appear in a searable and filterable list.
(Ref: description given by the Pull requests tab in the GitHub repository created)


## c. Describe the steps to **_open a pull request_**?
Note that I will be using the Git Assignment as an example
1. In your main repository  
    (i.e. git_assignment: https://github.com/sijiao-liu/git_assignment)
#### Method 1
2. Switch to the branch you created locally using the dropdown menu  
    (i.e assignment: https://github.com/sijiao-liu/git_assignment/tree/assignment)
3. If you see your recent push on top of your branch repository (i.e. assignment), then click on the button **_Compare & pull request_**.
4. Make sure you choose the right base (i.e. main) and compare (i.e. assignment)
5. Add a title: TITLE: UofT-DSI | <Module Name> - Assignment <assignment number>  
    (i.e. **_UofT-DSI | git - homework 1_**)
6. Add a description: explain your thought process. For example,
    * What changes are you trying to make? (e.g. Adding or removing code, refactoring existing code, adding reports)
    * What did you learn from the changes you have made?
    * Was there another approach you were thinking about making? If so, what approach(es) were you thinking of?
    * Were there any challenges? If so, what issue(s) did you face? How did you overcome it?
    * How were these changes tested?
    * A reference to a related issue in your repository (if applicable)
    * Checklist: - [ ] I can confirm that my changes are working as intended
7. Click on the button **_Create pull request_**

#### Method 2
8. Click on **_Pull requests_** tab
9. Under the **_Comparing changes_** section, make sure you choose the right base (i.e. main) and compare (i.e. assignment), then the button **_Create pull request_** will become green and clickable.
10. Click on the **_Create pull request_** button.
11. Apply step **_5-7 from Method 1_**.


## d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
